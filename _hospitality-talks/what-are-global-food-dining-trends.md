title: "What are Global Food & Dining Trends"
description: |
  Widespread changes in food preferences and dining experiences are being experienced globally. Some such trends prove to be long-lasting while others tend to be more of a fad. Please join us for a discussion regarding the crucial connection between consumer trends, behavior, and values, to provide context for the sectors, demographics and global themes that can help us prepare for the future. Hospitality Talks is thrilled to bring a global panel together. We are joined by Deepak Ohri – Chief Executive Officer, Lebua Hotels & Resorts; Ziad El Kerdany – Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Revel Hospitality and Matthew Jaffe – Managing Partner, Capital Burger.
