title: "Transformational Leadership in Tumultuous Times"
description: |
  Business executives have varying perspectives on the approach and qualities necessary for effective leadership. Great leaders adapt to their surrounding environments and empower the team to succeed together. Leading in turbulence requires keeping up an active presence. Leaders need to demonstrate internally and externally that uncertainty creates opportunities and that a well-led organization pursues value creation in good times and bad. Please join Hospitality Talks for a discussion regarding this very important topic with Rick Smith – Vice Dean Corporate and Global Partnerships, Johns Hopkins University; Alma Seidel – Vice President Human Resources, Real Hospitality Group and Samantha Crowe – Founder and CEO, Evalia Consulting.
