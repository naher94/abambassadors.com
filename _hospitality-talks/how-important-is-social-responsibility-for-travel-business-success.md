title: "How Important is Social Responsibility for Travel Business Success"
description: |
  Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the idea that a business has a responsibility to the society that exists around it. Until recently, most businesses were driven almost exclusively with a single goal in mind: profit. Most firms are driven to embrace corporate social responsibility due to moral convictions and doing so can bring several benefits. Hospitality Talks is thrilled to have industry leaders to help us understand the successes through conducting business responsibly. Please join Jared Meyers – Co-Founder & Chairman, Legacy Vacation Resorts; Portia Hart – Founder Blue Apple Beach House, and Jake Haupert – Co-Founder, Transformational Travel Council.
